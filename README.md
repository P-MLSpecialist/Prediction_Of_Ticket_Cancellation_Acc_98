# Prediction Of Ticket Cancellation

## Introduction

This project aims to tackle the challenge of predicting ticket cancellations for a travel booking website. Cancellations not only disrupt travel plans but also lead to financial penalties for the ticket registration site.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a strong predictive model that can identify potential ticket cancellations with high accuracy.

## Solution

To achieve the objective, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the dataset to identify patterns and build an accurate predictive model. We considered various factors such as departure time, payment status, passenger demographics, and trip details.

## Results

The resulting model has emerged as a powerful tool for risk mitigation within the company and serves as a guide for identifying potential cancellations proactively. With an impressive accuracy of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.93, the model showcases its expertise in predictive analytics.
